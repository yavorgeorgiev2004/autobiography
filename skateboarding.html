        <h1>Skateboarding</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>History of Skateboarding</h2>
            <p>Skateboarding began in the 1950s when surfers in California wanted to surf on land. Over decades it evolved into a global culture.
                The history of skateboarding is it all began when a group of surfers from California were trying to ride waves on the ground and over time it evolved into an olympic sport, there are two main skateboarding styles street and park skateboarding, in street skateboarding skaters use urban infrastructure like stairs, rails, ledges, bins, signs and anything you can find on the street to showcase their technical skills the best skaters get sponsored and featured on a magazine called Thrasher, the oldest skateboarding magazine. Park skating involves ramps and manmade structures like pools and ramps for skating.</p>

            <h2>M32 Skatepark </h2>
            <p>This is one of my favorite local skateparks it is a diy skatepark and has been build by skaters for skaters, it is a very popular skatepark during the winter months as it is sheltered by the motorway above it.</p>

            <h2>The Plaza</h2>
            <p>The Plaza refers to a popular flatgound spot with ledges in the city centre, where loads of skaters go to during the winter months as it has bright lights due to it being in the middle of the city center, the council made efforts to reduce the vast amount of skaters in the area with skatestopers between the tiles but it only gave us another obsticle to do tricks off of. Here is a picture of me doing a trick over a beer crate from the local pub. </p>
